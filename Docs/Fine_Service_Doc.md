#  Fine Service

The **Fine Service** handles overdue tracking and fine calculations in the Library Management System. It monitors late returns from the Borrowing Service, calculates penalties based on overdue days, and enables members to view and pay fines. It operates independently and is integrated through Eureka for discoverability.
